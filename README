Slideshare API for CodeIgniter

Is based on previous work made by author Aadhar Mittal
https://github.com/slideshare/SlideshareAPIExamples/tree/master/PHPKit/SSUtil

Ported to CodeIgniter as a CI library, some fixed were made to be able to use new API functions 
and recent changes.

In order to use, download and copy files to your project. Then edit config/slideshare.php with your
API Key and Secret Key.
